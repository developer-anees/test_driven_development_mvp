# Test Driven Development using MVP architecture
In this repository I'm mainly following the approach of test driven development. I won't be
implementing any view related stuff live populating recyclerview etc.

#### Things I have done so far in this code base
- **Test driven development** approach.
- Notice the test code, I'm **continuously modifying test code based on the requirement**.
- **MVP architecture** to fetch data from database.
- **Room database** for storing and retrieving the data.
- Added **RxJava/RxAndroid** for doing operation on background thread.
- Added **retrolambda** to optimize code.
- Introduced **Dagger2** to code base.

Note: Check each commits in this repository, it will be helpful if you are referring this code for
learning purpose.

Feel free to use this code and play with it, let me know if I can make any further improvements.

Thank you!üòäüôè
