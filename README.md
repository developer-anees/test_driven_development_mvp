# Test Driven Development using MVP architecture
In this repository I'm mainly following the approach of test driven development. I won't be
implementing any view related stuff live populating recyclerview etc.

#### Things I have done so far in this code base
- **Test driven development** approach.
- Notice the test code, I'm **continuously modifying test code based on the requirement**.
- **MVP architecture** to fetch data from database.
- **Room database** for storing and retrieving the data.
- Introduced **RxJava/RxAndroid** for doing operation on background thread.
- Introduced **retrolambda** to optimize code.
